I am a prospective Data Scientist who has recently completed the Data Science Immersive program at General Assembly NYC in July 2018. I have a background in Political Science, Spanish language, and Music, and have played in a variety of bands in Brooklyn while working in the foodservice industry. Currently relocated back to my home city of Boston, I am looking forward to launching a career that combines the quantitative toolbox of Data Science with the qualitative skillset of Social Science, with especial consideration given to the ethical issues of working with human subjects in research. When I am not working, I enjoy reading, biking, running, and attempting to prevent my musical skills from dwindling.
